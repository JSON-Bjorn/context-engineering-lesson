      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright
      owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on
      behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition,
      "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written

      "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Step 2: Pre-Packaging Tests

### Test 1: JSON Validation

```bash
# Validate all JSON files
python3 << EOF
import json
import sys

files = [
    'data/source_documents.json',
    'data/evaluation_questions.json',
    'data/context_examples.json'
]

for filepath in files:
    try:
        with open(filepath) as f:
            json.load(f)
        print(f'✅ {filepath} - Valid JSON')
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'❌ {filepath} - Invalid: {e}')
        sys.exit(1)

print('\n✅ All JSON files valid')
EOF
```

### Test 2: Python Syntax

```bash
# Check all Python files for syntax errors
python3 -m py_compile src/*.py
echo "✅ All Python files compile successfully"
```

### Test 3: Token Count Verification

```bash
# Verify token counts in documents
python3 << EOF
import json
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.get_encoding("cl100k_base")

with open('data/source_documents.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

errors = []
for doc in data['documents']:
    stated = doc['tokens']
    actual = len(enc.encode(doc['content']))
    diff = abs(stated - actual)
    
    if diff > 10:  # Allow 10 token tolerance
        errors.append(f"{doc['id']}: stated={stated}, actual={actual}, diff={diff}")
    else:
        print(f"✅ {doc['id']}: {actual} tokens (within tolerance)")

if errors:
    print("\n❌ Token count errors:")
    for err in errors:
        print(f"  {err}")
else:
    print("\n✅ All token counts accurate")
EOF
```

### Test 4: File Permissions

```bash
# Ensure scripts are executable
chmod +x run_lesson.sh
chmod +x scripts/setup_venv.sh

# Verify
ls -la run_lesson.sh scripts/setup_venv.sh | grep 'x'
echo "✅ Scripts are executable"
```

### Test 5: Size Check

```bash
# Check total size (should be <50 MB before models)
du -sh .
echo "Expected: <50 MB"
```

---

## Step 3: Create the Zip File

### Packaging Commands

```bash
# Navigate to parent directory
cd ..

# Create zip with proper naming
zip -r VG_[Firstname]_[Lastname]_$(date +%Y%m%d).zip VG_[Firstname]_[Lastname]_[Date]/ \
  -x "*.git*" \
  -x "*__pycache__*" \
  -x "*.pyc" \
  -x "*/.venv/*" \
  -x "*/progress/lesson_*.json"

# Verify zip contents
unzip -l VG_[Firstname]_[Lastname]_*.zip | head -20

# Check zip size
ls -lh VG_[Firstname]_[Lastname]_*.zip
echo "Expected: <50 MB"
```

### Alternative: Using tar.gz (if preferred)

```bash
tar -czf VG_[Firstname]_[Lastname]_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz \
  --exclude='.git' \
  --exclude='__pycache__' \
  --exclude='*.pyc' \
  --exclude='.venv' \
  --exclude='progress/lesson_*.json' \
  VG_[Firstname]_[Lastname]_[Date]/
```

---

## Step 4: Post-Packaging Verification

### Verification Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# verify_package.sh - Run this after creating zip

ZIP_FILE="VG_[Firstname]_[Lastname]_$(date +%Y%m%d).zip"

echo "=================================="
echo "Package Verification"
echo "=================================="
echo ""

# Check 1: File exists
if [ -f "$ZIP_FILE" ]; then
    echo "✅ Zip file exists: $ZIP_FILE"
else
    echo "❌ Zip file not found"
    exit 1
fi

# Check 2: Size check
SIZE=$(du -h "$ZIP_FILE" | cut -f1)
echo "✅ Size: $SIZE (should be <50 MB)"

# Check 3: Extract to temp and test
echo ""
echo "Extracting to temp directory for testing..."
TEMP_DIR=$(mktemp -d)
unzip -q "$ZIP_FILE" -d "$TEMP_DIR"

# Check 4: Verify key files
echo ""
echo "Checking key files..."
cd "$TEMP_DIR"/VG_*

[ -f "index.html" ] && echo "✅ index.html" || echo "❌ Missing index.html"
[ -f "run_lesson.sh" ] && echo "✅ run_lesson.sh" || echo "❌ Missing run_lesson.sh"
[ -f "requirements.txt" ] && echo "✅ requirements.txt" || echo "❌ Missing requirements.txt"
[ -f "LICENSE" ] && echo "✅ LICENSE" || echo "❌ Missing LICENSE"
[ -f "notebooks/context_engineering_lesson.ipynb" ] && echo "✅ Notebook" || echo "❌ Missing notebook"
[ -f "src/verify.py" ] && echo "✅ verify.py" || echo "❌ Missing verify.py"
[ -f "data/source_documents.json" ] && echo "✅ Documents" || echo "❌ Missing documents"

# Check 5: Count files
echo ""
TOTAL_FILES=$(find . -type f | wc -l)
echo "✅ Total files: $TOTAL_FILES (expected ~21)"

# Cleanup
cd -
rm -rf "$TEMP_DIR"

echo ""
echo "=================================="
echo "✅ Package verification complete!"
echo "=================================="
```

---

## Step 5: Student Testing Procedure

### Complete Test Run

```bash
# Extract package
unzip VG_[Name]_[Date].zip
cd VG_[Name]_[Date]/

# Follow student workflow
cat index.html  # Read instructions

# Setup environment
bash scripts/setup_venv.sh
source .venv/bin/activate

# Verify dependencies
python -c "import transformers; import torch; print('✅ Dependencies OK')"

# Test data loading
python -c "from src.helpers import load_documents; docs = load_documents('data/source_documents.json'); print(f'✅ Loaded {len(docs)} documents')"

# Open notebook (don't run all cells, just verify it loads)
jupyter notebook notebooks/context_engineering_lesson.ipynb

# Test verify script (should fail initially)
python src/verify.py
# Expected: FAIL (no results yet)

echo "✅ Student workflow test complete"
```

# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Zip Too Large

**Symptom:** Zip file >100 MB

**Causes:**
- .venv included
- __pycache__ included
- Model cache included

**Solution:**
```bash
# Re-create zip with proper exclusions
zip -r package.zip project/ \
  -x "*/.venv/*" \
  -x "*/__pycache__/*" \
  -x "*/.cache/*"
```

### Issue 2: JSON Validation Errors

**Symptom:** JSON files won't load

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use Python to format JSON properly
python3 << EOF
import json

with open('data/source_documents.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

with open('data/source_documents.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
EOF
```

### Issue 3: Permission Denied on Scripts

**Symptom:** Can't execute run_lesson.sh

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x run_lesson.sh scripts/*.sh
```

### Issue 4: Import Errors in Notebook

**Symptom:** "No module named 'src'" errors

**Solution:**
```python
# Add to notebook cell 2
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.append(str(Path.cwd().parent))
```
